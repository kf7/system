# About

Kohana is an open source, [object oriented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller "Model View Controller") [web framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework) built using [PHP 7](https://www.php.net/manual/intro-whatis "PHP Hypertext Preprocessor") by a team of volunteers that aims to be swift, secure, and small.

Note: Kohana is licensed under a [BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause), so you can legally use it for any kind of open source, commercial, or personal project.

## Features

Anything can be extended using the unique [filesystem](files.md) design, little or no [configuration](config.md) is necessary, [error handling](errors.md) helps locate the source of errors quickly, and [debugging](debugging.md) and [profiling](profiling.md) provide insight into the application.

To help secure your applications, tools for [input validation](security/validation.md), [signed cookies](security/cookies.md), form and HTML generators are all included. The [database](security/database.md) layer provides protection against [SQL injection](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection). Of course, all official code is carefully written and reviewed for security.
